<p>This is a common error in HTML that is often overlooked: using the wrong case for attribute values.</p><p>For example, the <code>type</code> attribute in an input element is case-sensitive.  If you write:</p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input type="text" value="Hello"&gt;</code></pre><p>This will work fine. However, if you write:</p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input TYPE="text" value="Hello"&gt;</code></pre><p>The browser might still render it correctly in many cases, but it is not valid HTML and could lead to unpredictable behavior in some situations or with stricter validation.</p><p>This also affects other attributes, although not all attributes are case-sensitive.  Consistency is key for better code maintainability and reliability.</p>
